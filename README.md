# About the Project:
- This is a CRUD To Do Application which was built using the PERN Stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React and NodeJS) + Typescript.
- User can: add a task, update a task name, mark a task as completed or important, delete the task, filter and sort tasks, and view the date when a task was created.
- The UI was built using Chakra-UI framework, dark and light theme were also added.
- Most importantly, manual authentication with JSONWebToken were integrated so that only the tasks that belong to a specific user are shown.
- What's more, forgot password, reset password were added and user can update their profile (e.g username and password) and delete their account.
- The website was deployed using Heroku for the server-side and Netlify for client-side.
